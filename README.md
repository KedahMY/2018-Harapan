# Project Description 
2018M is a mod in development for the website 'The New Campaign Trail'. This mod simulates the consequential 2018 general election in Malaysia where three coalitions, Pakatan Harapan (center-left), Barisan Nasional (center-right) and Gagasan Sejahtera (far-right) went head-to-head for majority control of all 222 parliamentary seats. This repository will store the Code 1 &amp; 2 for the 2018M mod.
