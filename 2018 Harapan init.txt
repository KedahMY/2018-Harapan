His tenure as Prime Minister was marked by economic liberalisation measures such as cuts to government subsidies, loosening of restrictions on foreign investment, and reductions in preferential measures for ethnic Malays in business. After the 2013 election, his government pursued a crackdown of its critics on sedition charges including the imprisonment of former opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim on sodomy charges. In 2015, Najib became implicated in a major corruption scandal involving state investment firm 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) which led to rallies calling for his resignation. Due to all these issues, Barisan Nasional is entering the general election under heavy attack on all corners for their handling of the economy, its heavy crackdown on political critics and the fallout of the 1MDB scandal.</p>",
